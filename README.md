![Acadence Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Smart%20India%20Hackathon-2025-blue?style=for-the-badge)

## 🚀 Overview

Attendance tracking in colleges is still plagued by outdated methods such as roll calls and paper registers. These consume valuable teaching time, lead to errors, and open doors to issues like **proxy attendance**. In larger classrooms, the challenge escalates, creating inefficiencies and lack of visibility.

**Acadence** is a next-gen **attendance automation and analytics platform** designed for higher education institutions. By integrating **QR codes, biometrics, or facial recognition**, Acadence eliminates manual processes and empowers faculty & administrators with real-time insights.
